Will be writing this and all reports in english as I am more used to writing technical documentation in english.

My main day-to-day language I write at work is **C# (.NET)** so I will try to make most of my code in that or Java. That
being said, the first insert node had a broken C# test code in HackerRank, so I will default to Java most of the time in
those cases.
